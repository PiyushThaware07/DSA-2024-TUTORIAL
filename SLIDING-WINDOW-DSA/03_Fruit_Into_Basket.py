Problem Statement : Fruit Into The Basket
Problem Description : You are given an array fruits where fruits[i] represents the type of fruit in a row of fruit trees. 
Your goal is to pick fruits such that you can only carry at most two types at a time. You must pick contiguous fruits from the array.
Return the maximum number of fruits you can collect in one go.

    Algorithm 
    1. Initialize Variables
        * Create a dictionary fruit_count to store the frequency of each fruit in the current window.
        * Set two pointers:
            l = 0 (left pointer) for the start of the sliding window.
            r (right pointer) for iterating over the array.
        * Initialize maxLength = 0 to track the longest valid subarray.
        
    2. Iterate Over the Array (r from 0 to n-1)
        * Add fruits[r] to fruit_count.
        * If fruits[r] is already in fruit_count, increase its count.
        * Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
        
    3. Shrink the Window If It Contains More Than 2 Fruit Types
        * While len(fruit_count) > 2 (more than two distinct fruits in the window):
            * Decrease the count of fruits[l] (leftmost fruit).
            * If fruit_count[fruits[l]] becomes 0, remove it from fruit_count.
            * Move the left pointer (l += 1) to shrink the window.
            
    4. Update Maximum Length
        * Calculate the valid subarray length: r - l + 1.
        * Update maxLength if the current window is the largest found so far.
        
    5. Return the Maximum Length Found
        * Print or return maxLength.
