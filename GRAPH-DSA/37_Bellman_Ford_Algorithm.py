Problem Statement: Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Shortest Path Algorithm with Negative Weights)

Why not Dijkstra's:
1. **Failure with Negative Weights**:
   - Dijkstra's algorithm is not designed to handle graphs with negative weight edges. It assumes all edge weights are non-negative, and using it with negative weights can lead to incorrect results or infinite loops.

2. **Failure with Negative Cycles**:
   - Dijkstra's algorithm also fails when a graph contains negative weight cycles. These cycles can cause the algorithm to produce incorrect shortest path estimates because it doesnâ€™t account for the possibility of repeatedly decreasing the shortest path cost by traversing such cycles.

Bellman-Ford, on the other hand, is specifically designed to work with graphs that contain negative weight edges and can also detect negative weight cycles. It relaxes all edges up to `V - 1` times (`V` being the number of vertices), ensuring that the shortest path estimates are correct or that a negative cycle is detected if one exists.
