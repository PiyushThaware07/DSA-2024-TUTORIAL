What is spanning tree --> A Spanning Tree is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the original graph with the minimum number of edges required to keep it connected. It does not contain cycles.
What is minimum spanning tree --> A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree where we have n-nodes and n-1 edges

Problem Statement : Prim's Algorithm
Problem Description : You are given a connected, weighted, and undirected graph with V vertices and E edges. Your task is to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Primâ€™s Algorithm and return the total weight of the MST.
